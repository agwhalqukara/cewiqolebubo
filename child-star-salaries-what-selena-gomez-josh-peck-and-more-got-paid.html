As with their Hollywood experiences, the money they’ve earned from their hit series and films varies wildly from actor to actor, show to show, movie to movie.</p><p>The salary <a href=#><strong>Josh Peck</strong></a> earned on<a href=#> Drake and Josh</a> — the hit Nickelodeon show that ran from 2004 to 2007 — was “certainly a great amount of money, but not enough to set you up for life,” he revealed on the “Trading Secrets” podcast in April 2022. “And a lot of it we lived on. … I’m not gonna brag: My mom and I had a used BMW five series. We lived in a two-bedroom apartment with amenities. … We lived a very middle-class life.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Happy People Are Annoying </a>author added that there are “no residuals on kids’ television,” so he doesn’t earn any money from the show’s reruns today. “It was like we had 18 months of runway,” he recalled. “It’s as though someone had lost their job.”</p><p>He explained, “When all is said and done, we were sort of left after agents and managers and taxes [were paid].”</p><p>Peck also touched on the idea that child stars on long-running hit shows most likely earn so much money that they are able to live comfortably for the rest of their lives — without ever having to work again.</p><p>“I can only speak to my experience, but I think it’s quite public that if you were on a show like <a href=#>Two and a Half Men</a> or <a href=#>Modern Family</a>, and you were the kid on a massive network, syndicated show … the case could be made that you’d have enough money to last you for the rest of your life,” he noted on the podcast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Wackness star might not be off base. <a href=#><strong>Angus T. Jones</strong></a> of Two and a Half Men made three times as much money per episode than Peck made for an entire season of Drake and Josh. The young Modern Family actors — <a href=#><strong>Sarah Hyland</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ariel Winter</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Nolan Gould</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Rico Rodriguez</strong></a> — were also earning more per episode of their hit series than the former Nick star made in a season.</p><p>Scroll below to find out how much child actors — including <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a>, the cast of Harry Potter and many more — were paid for their hit shows and movies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKm1y51krKyRp3q0rcuaqaKdo2LEqa3TZqqepJWjrm6zzqacs2WapMCpec%2BemqRlkaOxbrnOq5xmn5%2BperGtyJ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-jeff-goldblum-have-tattoos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Jeff Goldblum Have Tattoos?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carmen-zepeda-obituary-beloved-resident-of-jonesborough-tennessee-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carmen Zepeda Obituary: beloved resident of Jonesborough, Tennessee, cause of death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
