The “Toxic” singer then shares that she and Timberlake “agreed to move past” the infidelity given the years that she was “loyal to Justin” and “only had eyes for him.”</p><p>Speculation that Spears cheated on Timberlake has been swirling since the ‘NSync star released the music video for <a href=#>his song “Cry Me a River”</a> in 2003, one year after the duo parted ways.</p><p>The video, which features a Spears-lookalike model, seemed to suggest that the “Gimme More” musician had been unfaithful. Later that year, Spears told Rolling Stone that Timberlake warned her he was releasing a “controversial” video.</p><p>“He got what he wanted. I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally,” she told the outlet at the time. “But that was a great way to sell the record. He’s smart.”</p><p>In addition to owning up to a betrayal of her own in The Woman in Me, Spears also claimed in the memoir that Timberlake cheated on her with another famous woman. According to TMZ, Spears did not name the individual because she has a family of her own now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Britney-Spears-Accuses-Justin-Timberlake-of-Cheating-A-Couple-of-Times-in-Woman-in-Me2.jpg><p>The claims about Timberlake in Spears’ new tell-all don’t stop at infidelity. She also revealed that <a href=#>she became pregnant</a> while dating the “SexyBack” singer in the early 2000s.</p><p>“Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” she wrote in an excerpt, according to People.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Britney-Spears-Admits-to-Cheating-on-Justin-Timberlake-With-Wade-Robson-in-Book-554.jpg><p>Spears went on to claim that she made the choice to have an abortion because Timberlake wasn’t ready for parenthood.</p><p>“I’m sure people will hate me for this, but I agreed not to have the baby,” she wrote. “I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><p>Ahead of the memoir’s release, a second source exclusively told Us earlier this month that “Justin’s <a href=#>not going to be happy</a>” about the book, hinting that Spears “goes after him hard.”</p><p>However, a third source told Us that “it’s not Britney’s intention to skewer anyone,” adding that Spears simply relayed “the facts from her perspective.”</p><p>Spears and Timberlake dated from 1999 to 2002 after meeting in the early ‘90s while filming The Mickey Mouse Club. Timberlake went on to wed <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a> in 2012, with whom he <a href=#>shares sons</a> Silas, 8, and Phineas, 3.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Spears, meanwhile, shares sons Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>. She recently separated from <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari</strong></a>, who filed for divorce from Spears in August after 14 months of marriage.</p><p>The Woman in Me&nbsp;hits shelves on Tuesday, October 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHq0rdisZKyglWKwqbHArZydZZ%2BjeqvB0q2gp2WknrqjsdGlmKSdXay2tbSMsJidnV2nvKO%2Fzqdm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
