RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>In 1993, Huntsman and his wife founded the Huntsman Cancer Institute. As a four-time cancer survivor himself, it was and still is a cause near and dear to him. Since its founding, Huntsman has devoted his giving to the Huntsman Cancer Institute. The Institute was founded to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. It is one of the U.S.'s few National Cancer Institute designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers with leading edge research labs, a hospital, outpatient clinics, and the world's largest genetic database. The Huntsman Cancer Institute is also the only cancer hospital in the world designed by a cancer patient.</p><p>"I know there are people in my condition and others similar who can change that and make a difference. I don't like to see people suffering. It breaks my heart when I see people with cancer," Huntsman said.</p><p><span style=line-height:1.5>This month, Huntsman was honored with the prestigious Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. The Carnegie Medal is given annually individuals who, like <a href=# title="Andrew Carnegie Net Worth">Andrew Carnegie</a>, have dedicated their private wealth to the public good and who have impressive careers as philanthropists. During his acceptance, Huntsman said:</span></p><p>"The cancer institute is a vital part of curing cancer around the world," he said. "People see that it's the largest genetic cancer research center in the world. And they know cancer is going to be cured only through genetics and the study of this disease and why we get it – and how we can terminate it as soon as possible."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtflrqixsinnmagpaKur3nApZyrrF2Xtq24yKilmqGimnqru81mn66mpKi6orqMrKlmnJ%2BjrrWx0madqKqkqrumecWipZ2hnpx6pMHRnmScmZ6YsrN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-kopech-has-a-baby-with-his-girlfriend-morgan-eudy-kids-parents-and-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Kopech Has A Baby With His Girlfriend Morgan Eudy?
