I was careless. I was reckless, and I fell prey to drug addiction.”</p><p>Sorrentino shares his story in his new memoir, Reality Check: Making the Best of The Situation — How I Overcame Addiction, Loss, and Prison, due to be published December 19.</p><p>Sorrentino’s reality TV fame led to several endorsements, including clothing, liquor and vitamin brands. While earning huge paychecks, he <a href=#>served eight months in prison</a> in 2019 after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion for not paying taxes on $9 million.</p><p>Sorrentino recalled how becoming rich pulled him into the dark side of life in the fast lane.</p><p>“I was a young and wild, careless kid, and once you gave kids millions of dollars and Ferraris and Lambos and girls screaming my name and yes-men everywhere, it was hard to turn that off,” he said. “That was my problem for many years — how do you turn off the excess? And I think it wasn’t just my problem. Most people in our world or in the celebrity world or in the entertainment world, they have a problem turning off the excess button.”</p><p>Sorrentino remembered his addiction snowballed and he was completely out of control.</p><p>“I was into everything. I had everything on me at all times in my Louis Vuitton bag. Everything — from a couple hundred Roxicet, which are 30 milligram oxycodone, then I’d have probably 150 Percocets on me, which are 10 milligram oxycodone,” he told ET. “Then I would have about 100 Xanax on me, 100 Valium, and if I wasn’t traveling on a plane maybe I would have some weed and cocaine as well, ’cause I knew that if I traveled on a plane, not a good idea to try and go through security with cocaine and weed on you.”</p><p>In May 2018, Sorrentino talked about the consequences of his drug addiction.</p><p>“I went down this road for many years. Of experimenting, partying, making bad decisions because, when you’re addicted, everything is affected by that substance,” He told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Asbury Park Press.</a> “You don’t eat correctly, you don’t sleep correctly. Your relationships are affected and you don’t even realize that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mike-The-Situation-Sorrentino-Admits-He-Spent-500K-on-Cocaine-and-Oxycodone-I-Was-Reckless-2.jpg><p>Sorrentino completed a rehabilitation program in 2012 but later suffered a relapse. He was finally able to turn his life around when sought treatment for his addiction a second time three years later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I finally got to rehab in 2015 that was definitely my low, but my lowest was like a day or so before that, when I did something I never thought I was gonna do,” he remembered. “I ended up trying a drug that I never thought I would try. A drug that kills most people. A drug that most people don’t come back from. A drug that I told myself that I would never do, that I thought was dirty. It was heroin.”</p><p>Sorrentino has now been sober for eight years, and he credits his wife, <strong>Lauren Sorrentino</strong>, with whom he is <a href=#>currently expecting his third child,</a> and his mother, <strong>Linda Sorrentino</strong>, for saving him when needed help to turn his life around.</p><p>“I was depressed and [with] anxiety and self-doubt,” he said. “I had given up on myself. I just wanted to get out of that space mentally.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZuaerW0xGaqoqyllsGqu81mqqiqopq7tbXNqGSsqJWjwW6Bj2miZqeeYrCwr8CipZ5lkaOxbrvXspqonJ%2Bjsm5%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-caporella-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nick Caporella Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-samuels-wiki-everything-from-his-age-wife-death-to-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Samuels Wiki: Everything from His Age, Wife, Death, to Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
