Irish poet and novelist Frances Browne first published it in 1856. The book is full of charm, and Browne masterfully paints vivid pictures with her words making it surprising to learn that she was blind. A brief biography in the preface of a 1916 publication of her book describes Browne as follows:</p><p>“That she was a poet the story tells on every page, but of her blindness it tells not a word. From beginning to end it is filled with pictures; each little tale has its own picturesque setting, its own vividly realised scenery. Her power of visualisation would be easy to under¬stand had she become blind in the later years of her life, when the beauties of the physical world were impressed on her mind; but Frances Browne was blind from infancy. The pictures she gives us in her stories were created, in darkness, from material which came to her only through the words of others. In her work are no blurred lines or uncertainties . . . . It would seem that the completeness of her calamity created, within her, that serenity of spirit which contrives the greatest triumphs in Life and in Art.”1</p><p>Frances was born into poverty as the seventh of twelve children in County Donegal, Ireland. Nevertheless, she secured her own education by bribing her brothers and sisters to read to her in exchange for doing their household chores. And her biographer tells us:</p><p>“When the usual bribe failed, she invented stories for them, and, in return for these, books were read to her which, while they seemed dull and uninteresting enough to the readers, built up for the eager listener those enchanted steps by which she was to climb into her intellectual kingdom.”2</p><p>By 1840, Browne began writing and publishing poems. One of her sisters served as her secre-tary, writing down the words that Browne dictated.3 Seven years later, after achieving some fame as a poet, Browne left her mountain village to begin a literary career in Edinburgh, Scotland. Despite working fervently and publishing regularly, Browne’s income was modest. And though she was poor herself, she financially supported her mother.</p><p>After five years in Scotland, Browne relocated to London, England. She had the good fortune of receiving a generous sum of money from a nobleman, and this allowed her to write without the pressures of generating regular income. She was able to expand her literary efforts to include novels and children’s stories, the most popular of which is Granny’s Wonderful Chair. The story is about a poor girl named Snowflower whose grandmother tells her the secret of her magic chair. All Snowflower had to do was sit in the chair and imagine a place that she would like to visit. The chair would travel wherever she wished or tell a story whenever she asked. Snowflower requests that the chair take her to the court of King Winwealth, and there the chair tells stories before a grand audience. The first of these stories is “The Christmas Cuckoo.”</p><p>The tale is about two poor brothers, Scrub and Spare, who unknowingly bring a cuckoo (one of the most common birds found in western Europe) into their home on Christmas day. When they discover the bird tucked in their firewood, they agree to let it stay until spring. When it comes time for the cuckoo to set off and “shout its spring cry throughout the world,” it offers to bring back a gift. Essentially, the brothers are allowed to choose between riches or contentment. Their contrasting choices call to mind the followings verses:</p><p>“But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs” (1 Timothy 6:6-10).</p><p>Since Christmas is a time of gift giving, there tends to be an unfortunate focus on material things. This story serves as a reminder that contentment is of much greater value that the riches of the world.</p><p>The following text is an adapted version of the story as found in Good Stories for Great Holidays by Frances Jenkins Olcott (1873-1963). In addition to writing many children’s books herself, Olcott was head of the Children’s department at Carnegie Library. She is widely known for her efforts to distribute children’s literature throughout the United States.</p><p><span><strong>Sources:</strong></span></p><p><span>1 Browne, Francis.

All its inhabitants were poor, for their fields were barren, and they had little trade; but the poorest of them all were two brothers called Scrub and Spare, who followed the cobbler’s craft. Their hut was built of clay and wattles. The door was low and always open, for there was no window. The roof did not entirely keep out the rain and the only thing comfortable was a wide fireplace, for which the brothers could never find wood enough to make sufficient fire. There they worked in most brotherly friendship, though with little encouragement.</p><p>On one unlucky day a new cobbler arrived in the village. He had lived in the capital city of the kingdom and, by his own account, cobbled for the queen and the princesses. His awls were sharp, his lasts were new; he set up his stall in a neat cottage with two windows. The villagers soon found out that one patch of his would outwear two of the brothers’. In short, all the mending left Scrub and Spare, and went to the new cobbler.</p><p>The season had been wet and cold, their barley did not ripen well, and the cabbages never half- closed in the garden. So the brothers were poor that winter, and when Christmas came they had nothing to feast on but a barley loaf and a piece of rusty bacon. Worse than that, the snow was very deep and they could get no firewood.</p><p>Their hut stood at the end of the village; beyond it spread the bleak moor, now all white and silent. But that moor had once been a forest; great roots of old trees were still to be found in it, loosened from the soil and laid bare by the winds and rains. One of these, a rough, gnarled log, lay hard by their door, the half of it above the snow, and Spare said to his brother, “Shall we sit here cold on Christmas while the great root lies yonder? Let us chop it up for firewood, the work will make us warm.”</p><p>“No,” said Scrub, “it’s not right to chop wood on Christmas; besides, that root is too hard to be broken with any hatchet.”</p><p>“Hard or not, we must have a fire,” replied Spare. “Come, brother, help me in with it. Poor as we are there is nobody in the village will have such a yule log as ours.”</p><p>Scrub liked a little grandeur, and, in hopes of having a fine yule log, both brothers strained and strove with all their might till, between pulling and pushing, the great old root was safe on the hearth, and beginning to crackle and blaze with the red embers.</p><p>In high glee the cobblers sat down to their bread and bacon. The door was shut, for there was nothing but cold moonlight and snow outside; but the hut, strewn with fir boughs and ornamented with holly, looked cheerful as the ruddy blaze flared up and rejoiced their hearts.</p><p>Then suddenly from out the blazing root they heard: “Cuckoo! cuckoo!” as plain as ever the spring-bird’s voice came over the moor on a May morning.</p><p>“What is that?” said Scrub, terribly frightened; “it is something bad!”</p><p>“Maybe not,” said Spare.</p><p>And out of the deep hole at the side of the root, which the fire had not reached, flew a large, gray cuckoo, and lit on the table before them. Much as the cobblers had been surprised, they were still more so when it said, “Good gentlemen, what season is this?” “It’s Christmas,” said Spare.</p><p>“Then a merry Christmas to you!” said the cuckoo. “I went to sleep in the hollow of that old root one evening last summer, and never woke till the heat of your fire made me think it was summer again. But now since you have burned my lodging, let me stay in your hut till the spring comes round — I only want a hole to sleep in, and when I go on my travels next summer be assured I will bring you some present for your trouble.”</p><p>“Stay and welcome,” said Spare, while Scrub sat wondering if it were something bad or not.</p><p>“I’ll make you a good warm hole in the thatch,” said Spare. “But you must be hungry after that long sleep — here is a slice of barley bread. Come help us to keep Christmas!”</p><p>The cuckoo ate up the slice, drank water from a brown jug, and flew into a snug hole which Spare scooped for it in the thatch of the hut. Scrub said he was afraid it wouldn’t be lucky; but as it slept on and the days passed he forgot his fears.</p><p>So the snow melted, the heavy rains came, the cold grew less, the days lengthened, and one sunny morning the brothers were awakened by the cuckoo shouting its own cry to let them know the spring had come.</p><p>“Now I’m going on my travels,” said the bird, “over the world to tell men of the spring. There is no country where trees bud, or flowers bloom, that I will not cry in before the year goes round. Give me another slice of barley bread to help me on my journey, and tell me what present I shall bring you at the twelvemonth’s end.”</p><p>Scrub would have been angry with his brother for cutting so large a slice, their store of barley being low, but his mind was occupied with what present it would be most prudent to ask for.</p><p>“There are two trees hard by the well that lies at the world’s end,” said the cuckoo; “one of them is called the golden tree, for its leaves are all of beaten gold. Every winter they fall into the well with a sound like scattered coin, and I know not what becomes of them. As for the other, it is always green like a laurel. Some call it the wise, and some the merry, tree. Its leaves never fall, but they that get one of them keep a blithe heart in spite of all misfortunes, and can make themselves as merry in a hut as in a palace.”</p><p>“Good master cuckoo, bring me a leaf off that tree!” cried Spare.</p><p>“Now, brother, don’t be a fool!” said Scrub; “think of the leaves of beaten gold! Dear master cuckoo, bring me one of them!”</p><p>Before another word could be spoken the cuckoo had flown out of the open door, and was shouting its spring cry over moor and meadow.</p><p>The brothers were poorer than ever that year. Nobody would send them a single shoe to mend, and Scrub and Spare would have left the village but for their barley-field and their cabbage-garden. They sowed their barley, planted their cabbage, and, now that their trade was gone, worked in the rich villagers’ fields to make out a scanty living.</p><p>So the seasons came and passed; spring, summer, harvest, and winter followed each other as they have done from the beginning. At the end of the latter Scrub and Spare had grown so poor and ragged that their old neighbors forgot to invite them to wedding feasts or merrymakings, and the brothers thought the cuckoo had forgotten them, too, when at daybreak on the first of April they heard a hard beak knocking at their door, and a voice crying, “Cuckoo! cuckoo! Let me in with my presents!”</p><p>Spare ran to open the door, and in came the cuckoo, carrying on one side of its bill a golden leaf larger than that of any tree in the North Country; and in the other side of its bill, one like that of the common laurel, only it had a fresher green.</p><p>“Here,” it said, giving the gold to Scrub and the green to Spare, “it is a long carriage from the world’s end. Give me a slice of barley bread, for I must tell the North Country that the spring has come.”</p><p>Scrub did not grudge the thickness of that slice, though it was cut from their last loaf. So much gold had never been in the cobbler’s hands before, and he could not help exulting over his brother.</p><p>“See the wisdom of my choice,” he said, holding up the large leaf of gold. “As for yours, as good might be plucked from any hedge, I wonder a sensible bird would carry the like so far.”</p><p>“Good master cobbler,” cried the cuckoo, finishing its slice, “your conclusions are more hasty than courteous. If your brother is disappointed this time, I go on the same journey every year, and for your hospitable entertainment will think it no trouble to bring each of you whichever leaf you desire.”</p><p>“Darling cuckoo,” cried Scrub, “bring me a golden one.”</p><p>And Spare, looking up from the green leaf on which he gazed as though it were a crown-jewel, said, “Be sure to bring me one from the merry tree.”</p><p>And away flew the cuckoo.</p><p>“This is the feast of All Fools, and it ought to be your birthday,” said Scrub. “Did ever man fling away such an opportunity of getting rich? Much good your merry leaves will do in the midst of rags and poverty!”</p><p>But Spare laughed at him, and answered with quaint old proverbs concerning the cares that come with gold, till Scrub, at length getting angry, vowed his brother was not fit to live with a respectable man; and taking his lasts, his awls, and his golden leaf, he left the wattle hut, and went to tell the villagers.</p><p>They were astonished at the folly of Spare, and charmed with Scrub’s good sense, particularly when he showed them the golden leaf, and told that the cuckoo would bring him one every spring.</p><p>The new cobbler immediately took him into partnership; the greatest people sent him their shoes to mend. Fairfeather, a beautiful village maiden, smiled graciously upon him; and in the course of that summer they were married, with a grand wedding feast, at which the whole village danced except Spare, who was not invited, because the bride could not bear his low-mindedness, and his brother thought him a disgrace to the family.</p><p>As for Scrub he established himself with Fairfeather in a cottage close by that of the new cobbler, and quite as fine. There he mended shoes to everybody’s satisfaction, had a scarlet coat and a fat goose for dinner on holidays. Fairfeather, too, had a crimson gown, and fine blue ribbons; but neither she nor Scrub was content, for to buy this grandeur the golden leaf had to be broken and parted with piece by piece, so the last morsel was gone before the cuckoo came with another.</p><p>Spare lived on in the old hut, and worked in the cabbage-garden. (Scrub had got the barley-field because he was the elder.) Every day his coat grew more ragged, and the hut more weather-beaten; but people remarked that he never looked sad or sour. And the wonder was that, from the time any one began to keep his company, he or she grew kinder, happier, and content.</p><p>Every first of April the cuckoo came tapping at their doors with the golden leaf for Scrub, and the green for Spare. Fairfeather would have entertained it nobly with wheaten bread and honey, for she had some notion of persuading it to bring two golden leaves instead of one; but the cuckoo flew away to eat barley bread with Spare, saying it was not fit company for fine people, and liked the old hut where it slept so snugly from Christmas till spring.</p><p>Scrub spent the golden leaves, and remained always discontented; and Spare kept the merry ones. I do not know how many years passed in this manner, when a certain great lord, who owned that village, came to the neighborhood. His castle stood on the moor. It was ancient and strong, with high towers and a deep moat. All the country as far as one could see from the highest turret belonged to its lord; but he had not been there for twenty years, and would not have come then only he was melancholy. And there he lived in a very bad temper. The servants said nothing would please him, and the villagers put on their worst clothes lest he should raise their rents.</p><p>But one day in the harvest-time His Lordship chanced to meet Spare gathering water-cresses at a meadow stream, and fell into talk with the cobbler. How it was nobody could tell, but from that hour the great lord cast away his melancholy. He forgot all his woes and went about with a noble train, hunting, fishing, and making merry in his hall, where all travelers were entertained, and all the poor were welcome.</p><p>This strange story spread through the North Country, and great company came to the cobbler’s hut — rich men who had lost their money, poor men who had lost their friends, beauties who had grown old, wits who had gone out of fashion — all came to talk with Spare, and, whatever their troubles had been, all went home merry.</p><p>The rich gave him presents; the poor gave him thanks. Spare’s coat ceased to be ragged, he had bacon with his cabbage, and the villagers began to think there was some sense in him.</p><p>By this time his fame had reached the capital city, and even the court. There were a great many discontented people there; and the king had lately fallen into ill humor because a neighboring princess, with seven islands for her dowry, would not marry his eldest son.</p><p>So a royal messenger was sent to Spare, with a velvet mantle, a diamond ring, and a command that he should repair to court immediately.</p><p>“Tomorrow is the first of April,” said Spare, “and I will go with you two hours after sunrise.”</p><p>The messenger lodged all night at the castle, and the cuckoo came at sunrise with the merry leaf.</p><p>“Court is a fine place,” it said, when the cobbler told it he was going, “but I cannot come there; they would lay snares and catch me; so be careful of the leaves I have brought you, and give me a farewell slice of barley bread.”</p><p>Spare was sorry to part with the cuckoo, little as he had of its company, but he gave it a slice which would have broken Scrub’s heart in former times, it was so thick and large. And having sewed up the leaves in the lining of his leather doublet, he set out with the messenger on his way to court.</p><p>His coming caused great surprise there. Everybody wondered what the king could see in such a common-looking man; but scarcely had His Majesty conversed with him half an hour, when the princess and her seven islands were forgotten and orders given that a feast for all comers should be spread in the banquet hall.</p><p>The princes of the blood, the great lords and ladies, the ministers of state, after that discoursed with Spare, and the more they talked the lighter grew their hearts, so that such changes had never been seen at court.</p><p>The lords forgot their spites and the ladies their envies, the princes and ministers made friends among themselves, and the judges showed no favor.</p><p>As for Spare, he had a chamber assigned him in the palace, and a seat at the king’s table. One sent him rich robes, and another costly jewels; but in the midst of all his grandeur he still wore the leathern doublet, and continued to live at the king’s court, happy and honored, and making all others merry and content.</p><p>********************</p><p>This page was created by:</p><p><img title="angie signature" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebratingholidays.com/Pictures/misc/angiesigpng.png alt="angie signature" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Back to main <a href=#>Christmas Stories</a> page.</p><p><span>We welcome your ideas!
