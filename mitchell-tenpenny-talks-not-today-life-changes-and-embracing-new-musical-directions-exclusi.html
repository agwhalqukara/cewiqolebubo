Tenpenny collaborated with <strong>Chris DeStefano, Michael Whitworth</strong>, and <strong>Claire Douglas</strong> to breathe new life into a song that has evolved alongside him.</p><p><img decoding=async data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Not-Today-1024x1024.jpg alt width=1024 height=1024 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I wrote a very ballad version of this song in college. And honestly, it was a bit different lyrically back then, you know, during my college years. At that point in life, you’re just kind of figuring things out, and it seems like everything weighs on you a little bit more than it does now. So, it was a very real, very emotional piece for me in college, essentially saying, ‘I know I’m going to get over this heartbreak, I know I’m going to be better, but just not today. Like not today, I’m going to wear it, I’m going to own it,'” <strong>Tenpenny</strong> shares with <strong>Celeb Secrets</strong> in an exclusive interview.</p><p>“I think it’s very important to take time to heal. And so, as I was learning that through college, I wrote what I always loved about that song. And I still love that song. But now it’s a completely different version. I wanted to give it a more up-tempo, new life. I’ve always loved that title. And over the years, as I’ve grown and found my wife, my partner for life, things have changed. So, I wanted to rewrite the song in a different way. It’s just a new take on where I am in life with a song that I wrote a long time ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Not-Today-1024x1024.jpg><p>Accompanying the release of “Not Today” is a <a href=#>striking music video</a>, directed by Jeff Johnson and featuring Tenpenny in a dramatic narrative set around an electric chair.</p><p>“Jeff sent me the treatment and the electric chair caught my eye immediately. It’s different, evocative. The video isn’t just about a breakup; it’s about a man wrongfully convicted, reminiscing the joys of his life as he faces his final moments. I loved the contrast between the song’s upbeat sound and the video’s dark theme.”</p><p>Performing “Not Today” on tour has brought new excitement for Tenpenny, as he sees the song resonate with fans live. “It’s been really cool to watch it grow, especially live. It’s one of my favorite songs to perform because it’s so energetic. Seeing fans start to sing along with the hook, that’s always the best part,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Z_P03921-1024x683.jpg><p>Beyond his music, Tenpenny is deeply committed to charitable work, particularly through his fund focused on the mental health aspects of battling cancer, inspired by his personal experiences. “I lost my father to cancer, and my mother is currently in remission. We focus on the mental side of battling the disease, providing care and access to mental health resources. It’s crucial to prepare mentally, and we’ve seen success stories when people approach it the right way,” he shares.</p><p>As for what’s next, Tenpenny hints at exciting developments in his upcoming album, inspired by his rekindled interest in rock music with <strong>Underoath</strong> who are currently on <strong>They’re Only Chasing Safety Tour</strong>.</p><p>“I’ve been revisiting some rock stuff, getting back into my emo vibes. We might have something pretty cool coming up on the new record related to that,” he adds.</p><p>With “Not Today,” Mitchell Tenpenny not only revisits a formative piece of his musical past but also looks forward to the future with excitement and optimism, both for his evolving sound and the impact he can make off the stage.</p><p>Take a listen to “Not Today” by watching the music video below and let us know what you think of it by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sliding into our DMs on Instagram at <a href=#>@celebsecretscountry</a> — don’t forget to stay tuned for more updates on Mitchell’s journey and new music releases.</p><p>For more Country news, visit <a href=#>CelebSecretsCountry.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKNjsLC5jqagrZuYmrmtedOepamdnqPGbsDApaKsZZ6kwW7Azp2YsmWcnrOmecKhmKeflah6orrDZpymmqKWsKq6xmalnq9dosK0tcKao2acmaeypMDIqKWsZZWtsK3B0qKtnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sidharth-malhotra-and-kiara-advani-look-happy-in-the-new-unseen-pics-from-their-wedding.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani look happy in the new unseen pics from their wedding</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./camille-guaty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Camille Guaty Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
