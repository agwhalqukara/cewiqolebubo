The individual parts are easy enough to understand, but it gets overwhelming fast.</p><p id=iimLxL>In this Loop Hero guide, we’ll give our tips for your several hours with the game. We’ll teach you how to think about your role (what you do in Loop Hero), choosing and placing cards, gathering resources, what to build first at your camp, and how to unlock new classes.</p><h2 id=su4zLS><strong>You have three roles in </strong><strong>Loop Hero</strong></h2><p id=CDwnjf>The odd thing about Loop Hero is that you don’t control any walking or fighting — the titular hero handles that on their own. Instead, you’ve got three distinct (but related) jobs: outfitter, world-builder, and city planner.</p><h5 id=pfWrAQ><strong>Outfitter</strong></h5><p id=WrSWzT>During a loop, the hero is autonomously walking around and slaying enemies that drop <strong>equipment</strong>, <strong>cards</strong>, and <strong>resources</strong>. As outfitter, you manage the equipment they find by comparing equipment’s stats and equipping the one with the bigger number.</p><h5 id=sbjxBL><strong>World-builder</strong></h5><p id=hpJKJP>As the hero fights, you build the world — think of it like playing as the board on which a board game takes place (or being a dungeon master in Dungeons & Dragons).</p><p id=G1ynK3>Dead enemies drop equipment like swords and shields, as well as <strong>cards</strong>. You place these cards around the map, complicating the loop. Some cards change the terrain (the black void around the loop), adding things like <strong>meadows</strong> and <strong>rocks</strong> for health boosts. Others change the loop itself (the path the hero walks), creating <strong>cemeteries</strong> and <strong>vampire mansions</strong> that spawn extra enemies — and more enemies means more drops.</p><h5 id=kg5gNw><strong>City planner</strong></h5><p id=ryEoly>In between trips along the titular loop, you’ll be planning and building out your hero’s <strong>camp</strong> with structures like a <strong>farm</strong>, <strong>smithy</strong>, and <strong>herbalist’s hut</strong>.</p><h5 id=O13scM><strong>Balancing the three</strong></h5><p id=6vDiRk>And that’s how all three roles are interrelated: In the hands-off part, the hero fights and collects things, and you’re in charge of making said hero more kill-y. More killing means more cards and better equipment. Placing cards lets the hero collect better, rarer, and more valuable resources. And that stuff turns into new camp buildings which unlock new cards and classes. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PutL_XdJJMyeRGUKD3chsQkkfSk=/0x0:2560x1440/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2560x1440):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363107/Loop_Hero_equip_loop_camp.png"><p id=nPm3rE>Your job is to balance those three tasks, and that starts with making sure your hero doesn’t get overwhelmed.</p><h2 id=VYfRhI><strong>Don’t place every card or you’ll overwhelm your hero</strong></h2><p id=LNKj95>If you don’t place a single card during a loop, the hero will happily continue fighting slimes in wastelands forever, collecting getting mediocre weapons and unexciting resources as rewards.</p><p id=6NsIl2>Placing cards means putting challenges in your hero’s way, and those challenges come with better rewards. Your job as world-builder (and equipment manager) is to balance your hero’s survival against the value of those rewards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l43npNCPH1erBuu78evzxq7HUC8=/0x0:2880x1622/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2880x1622):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363109/Loop_Hero_out_of_hand.jpg"><p id=Xpa8Jt>It’s tempting to drop every card along the path the moment they come into your hand. Very early in the game, this is mostly manageable. But it quickly gets out of hand.</p><p id=GERYb2>Instead, hold onto the enemy-generating cards. Don’t overwhelm your hero. Spread them out, save the ones you know will be hard to deal with (like <strong>swamps</strong>, for some reason), and take some time to think about their placement.</p><h2 id=F5pjSn><strong>Experiment with card placement for weird combinations</strong></h2><p id=GcKtIJ>Placing cards is straightforward enough. You pick a card, drop it in a valid spot (on the path, next to the path, or out in the void), and then wait for your hero to happen by. Some cards behave differently based on what’s nearby, though.</p><p id=zuRKB4>For example, placing nine <strong>rock</strong> or <strong>mountain</strong> cards in a three-by-three square transforms them into a <strong>mountain peak</strong>, which has different stats and daily actions than rocks and mountains. Similarly, <strong>meadows</strong> heal you for a couple points every morning. But a meadow placed so that it’s touching a different type of tile (like a mountain or rock) becomes a <strong>blooming meadow</strong> that gives an extra point of health each morning.</p><p id=vfoKAI>Experiment with card placement to see if you get any unexpected effects.</p><h2 id=MSoWER><strong>Keep an eye on your day meter</strong></h2><p id=CC8oNb>A <strong>day</strong> is Loop Hero’s timing mechanic, represented by the green gauge in the upper left corner of your screen. It’s a visual representation of the background math that controls everything from daily health bonuses to enemy spawns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jgIjwDKvKBZzDQZcV2dxXmAadX0=/0x0:2880x1622/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2880x1622):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363128/Loop_Hero_day_timer_gauge.jpg"><p id=EZEZKr>The day meter fills when you’re in adventure mode and stops when you’re paused in planning mode. When the gauge is full, that’s a day — you’ll hear an 8-bit rooster, and the next day begins. Loop Hero’s daily math happens when the meter resets (or when the day begins, if you prefer).</p><p id=XGYbqu>It’s like an egg timer in a board game determining when you get healing from meadows (and blooming meadows) and how often a wasteland tile spits out a slime. Other tiles, like the <strong>mountain peak</strong> we mentioned, generate enemies on a schedule (one <strong>harpy </strong>every two days). Those enemies appear in the morning, when the gauge resets.</p><p id=9OmcMs>On your first loop or two, there’s not much combat, so you’ll make it back around to the starting point (the <strong>cozy camp</strong> tile) before many days pass. For example, that means a <strong>spider cocoon,</strong> which spits out one spider each morning, will only have time to drop a couple spiders in your hero’s path.</p><p id=oigfAx>As you place more cards and more enemies show up, your hero’ll spend more time fighting, and loop takes longer. More days pass during each loop, and that spider cocoon, chugging along at one per day, has time to spit out six or eight spiders instead of just one or two. A tile can turn deadly just because you took too long to get there.</p><p id=dVCstY>Dying is a pain, because you lose 70% of the resources you’ve gathered.</p><h2 id=IUFap5><strong>Retreat to camp before you die</strong></h2><p id=TXEAvP>When you’re not on an expedition, you’re in Loop Hero’s camp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N64yKyeiXjZlUnAsxYW3AGXvqKs=/0x0:2880x1622/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2880x1622):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363136/Loop_Hero_retreat_button.jpg"><p id=Xac8XF>You can get to camp in three ways. Two of them involve pressing the retreat button (the icon in the lower right with a person running on it), but all three determine what <strong>resources </strong>you keep.</p><li id=YQx8MN><strong>Cozy camp tile</strong>. Hit the retreat button on the cozy camp tile (the start/finish campfire on a loop), and you’ll return with 100% of what you’ve gathered.</li><li id=hVBERY><strong>Retreat</strong>. Hit the retreat button anywhere other than the cozy camp tile, and you’ll keep 60% of your resources.</li><li id=9qdX9f><strong>Death</strong>. If you fall in battle, you’ll go back to camp with only 30% of your resources.</li><p id=oT2ZyT>It’s much better to take several trips where you leave early — preferably by returning (alive) via the cozy camp — than it is to overexert your hero and fall in battle. About three times better, if our math is right.</p><p id=r0mFjj>Keeping those resources matters, because you’ll need a lot of stuff to upgrade your camp.</p><h2 id=C3mtRn><strong>Build the herbalist hut and field kitchen first</strong></h2><p id=uAymVx>After you return to camp a few times, you’ll unlock the <strong>build</strong> menu. This turns those resources you’ve collected into new structures that expand the camp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQQ6Z5p7lOSw3iQ1Hakbu3mhXr4=/0x0:2560x1440/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2560x1440):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363140/Loop_Hero_build_menu.png"><p id=qZL4Hw>Build the <strong>herbalist’s hut </strong>first. This adds a <strong>healing potion </strong>to your hero’s equipment.</p><p id=lq1FyR>Healing potions automatically heal the hero when their health decreases to a certain threshold. (There’s a little marker above the health bar indicating when this will happen.) It’ll recharge by two doses every time your hero passes the cozy camp.</p><p id=82P0qC>You’ll also get healed every time you pass Go (the cozy camp tile). To get even more health each time you pass, build the <strong>field kitchen</strong>. That will bump the cozy camp’s healing by an extra 10%.</p><p id=2o25w3>Upgrade both buildings for even more health and more healing potion doses.</p><h2 id=1QC4UB><strong>Expand your camp to unlock new classes, cards, and upgrades</strong></h2><p id=Z5Rij3>Keep building out your camp with other structures from the build menu. New structures unlock new cards for your deck, different classes for your heroes, new kinds of resources, and even new mechanics.</p><p id=7Jvand>The <strong>refuge</strong> unlocks the rogue class, for example. The <strong>herbalist’s hut</strong>, <strong>field kitchen</strong>, and <strong>gymnasium </strong>each add a new card to your deck.</p><p id=tM1BfB>And that’s where Loop Hero loops(!) back around to our first tip about balancing your three roles. You place cards in the void to get better resources from your hero; better resources build new camp buildings; new camp buildings give you new cards; new cards give better resources; and the loop continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbvLsp6opl6YvK57y6imqWWYmr%2BwecauoJ2do2R%2Fc3%2BRam5vb1%2BXsqi1zaecq6tdqbaxv4ytqaKbm6h6sbjAp6WippdirqXCxKerrqqVYrCiuc9mmpqqlGLBqrjEZqelmZOaerGt06Fkm62ZobFuwc%2BgqZqclQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-the-richest-person-in-ukraine-and-how-are-they-reacting-to-russia-s-invasion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is The Richest Person In Ukraine And How Are They Reacting To Russia's Invasion?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./billie-eilish-gets-candid-about-living-with-tourette-s-syndrome.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Eilish Gets Candid About Living with Tourette's Syndrome</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
