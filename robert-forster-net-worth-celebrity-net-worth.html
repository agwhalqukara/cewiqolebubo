Why don't you read it?'.</strong>"</p><p>Six months later Forster walked into that coffee shop and saw Quentin.

Quentin replied: "<strong>I hire anybody I want.</strong>"</p><p>Forster gave a tour-de-force performance in the film and wound up getting nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><p>Tarantino has said that casting Forster in Jackie Brown was one of the best decisions he ever made.
