And now, with the show set to come to a close, fans are hoping for any loose ends to be tied-up and for the truth behind the mysterious crime to be revealed. However the whodunit will unfold, it's set to get viewers talking. Many have already been taking to social media throughout the week to voice their ideas on how the drama might end; so before we find out in Thursday's final instalment, let's take a look at all the potential theories on how could wrap.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eeJoVTuH1Uc data-wc=10><strong>WATCH: Imelda Staunton on her character in Flesh and Blood</strong></p><h2>Flesh and Blood: Mary is the murderer</h2><p id=eh-YPuBCTDc data-wc=89>Throughout the drama, Mary, played by <a class=hm-link href=#>Imelda Staunton</a>, has been a prime suspect in the show. Her shifty movements such as walking into Vivien's house uninvited, stealing her parcels and even knocking perfume off the shelf to startle a showering Mark, has led many to think that she's not one to be trusted. As well as this, her nosey nature in Vivien and her children's lives, and her suspicions towards Vivien's new partner, has resulted in one theory predicting that Mary is the perpetrator and Mark is the fateful victim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b7c25cc32185-imelda-staunton-coastal-town-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enO773x1gko7 data-wc=9><strong>Mary is one potential suspect in the mystery crime</strong></p><h2>Flesh and Blood: Jake kills Mark</h2><p id=eL7PFxyrAzCp data-wc=109>Episode three left viewers on the edge of their seat as the show ended on a huge cliffhanger. In the final ten minutes, Jake, played by Russell Tovey, came to blows with Mark, played by Stephen Rea, at his mum Vivien's 70th birthday party. Jake is questioned by the police about the injury on his hand, before the scene flashes back to the party, where he is punched by Mark before falling over and smashing a table. With Jake being questioned by police, but Mark then nowhere to be seen, this has made plenty of viewers reckon that Mark is in fact the victim and Jake is the perpetrator.</p><p id=e6GYwOrUK12c data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Flesh and Blood viewers convinced they know the killer after episode three's gripping cliffhanger</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86e8d134aed3-russell-tovey-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e6TkekLto2Ev data-wc=7><strong>Many think Jake could be to blame</strong></p><h2>Flesh and Blood: Mark kills Vivien</h2><p id=e5mboJtPu-RI data-wc=109>Since the first episode when we were first introduced to Vivien's new partner Mark, characters in the show, as well as those watching at home, have been consistently suspicious of his intentions. The drama has seen Mark marry Vivien in a very sudden wedding, shower her with extravagant gifts, and convince her to reorganise her will. This has led to one theory that Mark has been after his new wife's money the whole time, and that the ending will see him take her life. This is further fuelled by the fact that Vivien has not yet been seen in the police interview room, unlike many of the other characters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df63d8b03921-stephen-rea-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebzv2ZklhVGH data-wc=8><strong>Mark is both a potential suspect and victim</strong></p><h2>Flesh and Blood: Vivien is the injured victim in hospital</h2><p id=egN7lxbQJqzn data-wc=100>It's possible that more than one person fell victim to a crime that night. In one of the episodes so far, viewers spotted authorities removing what appears to be a body bag from the scene and throughout the show so far, investigators have been referring to a victim in hospital in a "critical condition." This certainly opens up the theory that perhaps one person lost their life, and another is still fighting for theirs. Many think that Mark injured Vivien, and then when her son Jake came to her defence, he acted in a rage and ended up killing Mark.</p><p id=eUUMSTwK7LAH data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Where is Flesh and Blood filmed?

Natalie and Jake have both been asked questions by investigators on their mum's life and relationship with Mark, but Helen, the eldest child, is yet to be seen in the interview room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b25b5cb1289b-claudie-blakley-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewsk9iIBZQaq data-wc=7><strong>Many think Helen could be in trouble</strong></p><p id=evncdwUn7AWS data-wc=44>Given that all children were present on the night in question, it's perhaps surprising that Helen hasn't yet been asked anything, and many seem to think this could mean that Helen has fallen victim to the crime.
