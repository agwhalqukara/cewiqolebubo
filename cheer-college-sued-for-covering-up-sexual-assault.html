The documentary series focused on Navarro College, a national leader in collegiate <a href=# rel>cheerleading</a>. Many of the show's stars, such as squad member Jerry Harris and coach <a href=# class=text-word rel>Monica</a> Aldama quickly became national celebrities. Navarro was not just at the top of the pyramid, they were on top of the world. Furthermore, the small town of Corsicana, Texas has gained international recognition.</p><p>However, the country was rocked, and season 2 heavily impacted, by the 2021 revelations about Harris. Harris was imprisoned for 12 years for sexually assaulting two minors he had met through cheer. Later revealed that Harris was a serial sexual predator and was in possession of a plethora of child pornography. However, the second season of the show seemed to clear the college. The party line was that Harris acted in secrecy and without anyone at Navarro knowing. Now the college and Coach Aldama are in additional legal trouble.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cheerleader-alleges-history-of-hiding-sexual-assault>Cheerleader Alleges History Of Hiding Sexual Assault</h2></span><p>Navarro College and cheerleading head coach Monica Aldama have been named in a shocking new lawsuit. The suit has been filed by former Navarro cheerleader Madi Lane, who alleges she was sexually assaulted by a male cheerleader in 2021. Lane has gone on to testify that multiple members of the team, including Aldama, told her to not go public. Additionally, Lane alleges that Aldama told her, "If you keep quiet, I’ll make sure you can cheer anywhere you want." Lane quit the team a few days after the incident.</p><p>However, the lawsuit does not stop there. It alleges a history of abuse being covered up by the college. Lane alleges that senior cheerleader Maddy Brum told her "You just need to drink it off and get your mind off it" and "We don't tell anyone. We just keep it to ourselves," when informed about the assault. The suit states that Navarro College and Aldama have long covered up sexual assault within the program to maintain its reputation. Navarro College has not responded to the lawsuit, nor has a representative for Aldama.
