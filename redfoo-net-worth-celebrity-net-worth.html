He attended junior high school in Los Angeles with future stars like will.i.am and GoonRock. He then attended Palisades Charter High School in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, graduating in 1993. By that time, he was already working as a producer for friends and local musicians.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1994, Redfoo experienced his first commercial success when he scored a production credit for the song "Back in the Day" by Los Angeles Rapper Ahmed.

They started building a local fan base and recorded a few demos. His friend, will.i.am, introduced the duo to the head of Interscope, <a href=#>Jimmy Iovine</a>. He signed them to Interscope/will.i.am Music. The duo impressed the label as their demo tapes sounded so good and their sound was so polished that very little needed to be done to get the duo ready for recording.</p><p>In 2009, LMFAO released their debut album, "Party Rock." The album charted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 album charts and snagged the second spot on the Billboard Dance Chart.
