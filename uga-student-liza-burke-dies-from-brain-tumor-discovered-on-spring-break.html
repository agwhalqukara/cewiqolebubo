Beane, the dog quickly sensed it and was downstairs while I was being awakened,” her mom Laura McKeithen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in an online journal</a> detailing her daughter’s final days.</p><p>“After Hospice was called, we dressed Liza in colorful pajamas, gifted by her boyfriend’s mother and Jack’s girlfriend, Elli, braided her hair.
