However, that did not happen, as the NFL authority sent an official email to change his mask.&nbsp;</p><p>“Why did you wear a helmet?” When the anchor asked him the question, the QB burst out. He said, “They may take my face mask off. They sent a nice email and said it had to go. Representing sobriety fullest, I got a tattoo on my neck, my hands, and everywhere. So I put my face mask.
