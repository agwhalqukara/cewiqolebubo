For whatever reason, Joe Kindregan, then only ten years old, was also at the airport. Kindregan, who suffered from the degenerative genetic disease ataxia-telengiectasia (A-T), was in a wheelchair, and Affleck struck up a conversation.</span></p><p>The pair quickly became friends, with Affleck inviting Kindregan to his movie sets and premieres. Affleck also testified with Kindregan before a congressional subcommittee to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health and perform stem cell research that might be able to help with similar diseases.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-223640 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-166189835.jpg alt width=900 height=558 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-223640 class=wp-caption-text>Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Affleck remained close with Kindregan as the boy grew up. The actor even spoke at Kindregan's high school graduation, telling the audience, "Everything I learned about life that really matters… I learned from Joe."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Affleck also added that Kindregan "liked being on the set of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Daredevil</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> a lot more than being on the set of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gigli</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But he was too polite to mention it."</span></p><p>When Kindregan turned 25, Affleck and his then-wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Garner</a> celebrated by matching donations up to $25,000 to a charity that funds research for A-T. They raised more than $58,000 for the foundation.</p><p>Though Kindregan sadly passed away in 2015 at the age of 27, Affleck continues to support research for and bring awareness to A-T. Most who have the disease are confined to a wheelchair by the time they're 10 years old, and many don't live past their teens.</p><p>Kindregan not only outlived his prognosis by at least a decade, he got to hang out in Hollywood circles and meet plenty of cool people. When Kindregan introduced Affleck during graduation, he called the actor "the best friend you could ever have."</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That friendship has had a lasting impact, leaving great memories for both Affleck and Kindregan's family.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCuxKdkmp6WobKkt4ybnJyZnZp6pLjOrJxmnqKesq%2Bw0maboquRl7mmsIysq66claPBbrLUp5uenF2nsrSxwKuaoWWWnrulecKuqZ5llJ7Apq3SnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danny-duncan-health-condition-2023-what-happened.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Danny Duncan Health Condition 2023: What Happened?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-ortiz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andy Ortiz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
