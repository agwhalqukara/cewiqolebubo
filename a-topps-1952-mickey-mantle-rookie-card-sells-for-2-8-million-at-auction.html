Some played basketball, others rode bikes. And some, collected baseball cards. While collecting sports cards was once viewed as an activity strictly for kids, last week's sale of a rare Mickey Mantle baseball card proved that the hobby has morphed into an activity for adults as well.</p><p>Last Thursday, a 1952 <a href=#>Mickey Mantle</a> Topps rookie card sold for $2.88 million; the second-highest price ever paid for a baseball card (a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner card sold for $3.12 million in October 2016). The Mantle card, which was graded a nine on a scale of 10, was via Heritage Auctions by retired NFL offensive lineman Evan Mathis, an 11-year NFL veteran.</p><p>Chris Ivy, who is the director of sports auctions at Heritage Auctions said, "It's a remarkable price… It was 10 years ago when we last had a Mantle 9 sell [for $240,000], but this sold for 10 times that." The previous record for Mantle's Topps rookie card was a PSA traded 8.5, which sold for $1.13 million in 2016.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-256871 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-51687165.jpg alt width=594 height=409 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-256871 class=wp-caption-text>(PAUL BUCK/AFP/Getty Images)</p><p>But what makes the story of last week's sale so interesting is that nobody wanted the cards when they were first released in 1952. The 1952 Topps set that Mantle's card was a part of had nearly no interest from consumers, and the high number packs from the set remained in the Topps factory for seven years. In the 1960s, a Topps employee by the name of Sy Berger couldn't even find a way to give them away. At one point he was offering 10 cards from the set for a penny.</p><p>Topps still had a number of cases of cards left over in the factory after the fact, so to make space, Berger decided to dump over 300 cases into the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>While the move does appear to be a mistake in hindsight, perhaps the cards wouldn't have been as coveted today had those 300-plus cases been in the open market.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2mqaijYn56gZFmpKKbm5rGbrnAp6ulnV2nvLC3yJ5knJmimXq0sculqmZqXW16rrXLpaCopl2WwqTAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-grimes-and-elon-musk-still-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Grimes and Elon Musk still together?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./too-hort-defends-lori-harvey-after-vlad-tv-and-boosie-badazz-reference-her-body-count.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Too $hort Defends Lori Harvey After Vlad TV and Boosie Badazz Reference Her Body Count</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-says-she-cheated-on-justin-timberlake-with-wade-robson.html>Britney Spears Says She Cheated on Justin Timberlake With Wade Robson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./douglas-lenat-net-worth-at-death.html>Douglas Lenat net worth at death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dr-savan-ghetiya-md-toms-river-nj.html>Dr. Savan Ghetiya, MD Toms River, NJ</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./in-we-trust.html>In ___ We Trust</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksana-s-baby.html>Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog.
