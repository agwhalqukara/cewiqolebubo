He claimed, “My history entrusts me with this duty.”</p><p>As a Muslim athlete of Turkish ancestry, he feels he has assimilated well and works to set an example for his fans.</p><p>To paraphrase, “so many people, not just Turkish people, but the Muslim community in Germany, I am one of those personalities to try to help,” he stated.</p><p>Gundogan is the latest in a long line of prominent German players who also happen to be Muslims.</p><p>Gündoan’s father, Irfan, and his siblings relocated to Germany in 1979. He got a job and decided to stay out in the country.</p><p>Ilkay Gundogan has a sibling named Ilker. The Gundogan brothers have a lot of love and respect for one another.</p><p>Naz Aydemir, their cousin, plays volleyball professionally for the Fenerbahçe Club and the Turkish women’s national team.</p><p>In May of 2018, Gündoan visited London to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, along with fellow German footballers of Turkish origin Mesut Ozil and Cenk Tosun.</p><p>He drew attention when he called Erdogan “my president,” even though he was a German citizen. The event sparked backlash, and when Gündoan played for Germany a few weeks later, the country’s supporters jeered at him.</p><p>Gundogan almost caused another incident when he “liked” a post by Tosun on Instagram in which Tosun celebrated a goal and expressed sympathy for Turkish soldiers fighting Kurdish forces in Syria.</p><p>He explained why he unliked something by saying, “After last year, the last thing I wanted to do was make a political statement.” He went on to say that he was happy for [Tosun], a former teammate on Germany’s U21 squad.</p><p>Gundogan just tied the knot with his lover Sara Arfaoui. According to reports, the couple began dating in early 2021 and tied the marriage in May of the following year.</p><p>Sara is an Italian-born model and actress of French descent. The beautiful woman’s parents originally hail from Nice, France, but they relocated to Italy when she was little. She’s been living and becoming a citizen of Italy ever since.</p><p>She is about five years younger than her husband, having been born in 1995, making her age 27.</p><p>The German footballer keeps his personal life behind wraps, refusing to discuss it with the media or even his fans.</p><p>The two were keeping their connection under wraps until a photo of them leaked on Sara’s Instagram.</p><p>Ilkay Gundogan’s new bride, Sara Arfaoui, and his new wife, Ilkay Gundogan. (The Sun is the source)<br>Gundogan’s ex-girlfriend’s name is Sila Sahin, and they were romantically involved in the past. His followers were taken aback by the news of their split.</p><p>But we’re happy that the player has closed that chapter and begun a new one with Sara.</p><p>The adorable pair also shared the news in an Instagram post not too long ago.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
